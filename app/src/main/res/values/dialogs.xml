    <string name="helpGrade_text">
        Moodle always calculates in percentage (0-100%). Grades are always in condition to this scala. If you set the maximal credits
        to 100 you can see this scala. Moodle always calculates with the percent scale, not with the grades.&lt;br>&lt;br>

        &lt;b>Maximal credits:&lt;/b>&lt;br>
        Here you can set the maximal credits for a test. The scored credits (middle column) will be set in relation to the maximal
        reachable credits in percent (left column). In the right column you can see the calculated grade.
